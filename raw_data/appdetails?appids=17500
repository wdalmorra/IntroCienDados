Source","steam_appid":17500,"required_age":0,"is_free":true,"detailed_description":"<h1>Upcoming Update Information<\/h1><p>We\u2019re happy to finally be able to announce that the v3.0 update for Zombie Panic! Source will be released on the <strong>8th of December<\/strong>, this year! Look to pass the time when the air is cold and the days are short? We've got you covered! A tiny bit past Fall, but not nearly during Winter!<br><br>As we continued work on the update, expectations grew. Former players, server owners and content creators kept expressing their excitement and hopes of this update bringing the game back to life. When issues with salvaging the original code let to temporary breaks in development, we started coming up with ideas on how to make the game look, sound and feel more modern \u2013 While still maintaining its game design that we believe is not found in many of today\u2019s games. <br><br>At times, this led us to develop new content which was not exactly part of the original plan for the update, but that we felt needed to be in the update to make it a success, even if it slowed development down at times. It\u2019s safe to say that we were treating the update as a one-shot-opportunity to reinstate the game. An ambition which ironically led us to become sidetracked when the schedule was affected by code issues. It sadly means that we aren't able to give everything the close attention it needs, but we have plans for more updates after v3.0. So, we do apologize but we still think you'll find the update worth the wait.<\/p><br><h1>About the Game<\/h1>Dive into the zombie apocalypse with Zombie Panic!
