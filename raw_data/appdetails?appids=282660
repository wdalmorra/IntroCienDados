EasyAntiCheat eSports is not compatible with any anti-cheat programs other than VAC, therefore you must not run EasyAntiCheat eSports if you wish to play with any other anti-cheat at the same time. The user is fully responsible in case his\/her game account or cdkey gets banned or refused by the game, EasyAntiCheat eSports or any other anti-cheat.<br><br>2. EasyAntiCheat eSports finds game cheats by scanning games' memory, the system memory and verifying original game files on disk to ensure they have not been modified. Only games' folders (and subfolders) are verified to contain original game data. EasyAntiCheat eSports may replace or remove permanently any modified or custom game files found in games' folders (and subfolders). The use of any custom models, textures, sprites or other modified game files may lead to permanent ban if they can be considered to give the player an unfair advantage over other players.<br><br>3. EasyAntiCheat eSports will during the runtime of Counter-Strike scan system registry to detect forbidden modifications, settings or other features enabled to the game or graphic card drivers.<br><br>4.
