Recorded over the course of several days in NYC on Wamble's signature Amistar resonator guitar, this collection of tracks covers a vast range of styles, from traditional Delta blues, to front porch folk, to singer-songwriter strumming, to dirty and distorted rock.  The result? One of the most eclectic and inspiring loop libraries we've ever released - The Doug Wamble Slide Guitar Collection.<br><br>During the recording process for this collection, we asked Doug about his approach to slide guitar playing:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">I am very influenced by the Delta blues slide guitar tradition, from Robert Johnson and Son House to Rev. Gary Davis and Mississippi Fred McDowell, and also by the sacred steel guitar tradition that most people know through Derek Trucks and Robert Randolph. But the greatest of them all, in my honest opinion, is Aubrey Ghent. So I pull from those things, as well as the great Chris Whitley's approach, and kind of fuse that on to my jazz background.<\/h2><br>Weighing in at a hefty 585 MB (with 385 individual guitar loops) The Doug Wamble Slide Guitar Collection is organized into six main sessions, each recorded in a different key and tempo, providing a vast library of both lead and rhythm tracks. Whether you're a pop musician seeking the unique tone and timbre of a resonator guitar (along with Wamble's incredible playing), scoring a film and looking for authentic slide guitar to set the scene, or searching for distinct acoustic elements to mix into your electronic compositions, this collection will supply you with the highest quality slide guitar loops available anywhere.","about_the_game":"<strong>All content included is royalty-free<\/strong><br><br>To produce our latest Loop Loft Artist Series release, we enlisted the talent of acclaimed guitarist, Doug Wamble (Wynton Marsalis, Norah Jones, Madeleine Peyroux, Branford Marsalis).
