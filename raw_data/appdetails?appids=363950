Instead of just letting you read a boring game description, please allow me to share my vision of the game I am creating. Hopefully you will like what I am working on.<br><br>Ever since my childhood I was a huge fan of the Zelda series of games, Golden Axe Warrior, Secret of Mana and games in which let you explore a vivid world without time pressures and a too restrictive storyline. Over the past year and a half I\u2019ve been working on my vision of a modern exploration adventure, combining it with my fondness for modern crafting and sandbox games. <br><br>In Windscape you play as a young girl living on your parents\u2019 farm, set in a lovely world made up of floating islands in the sky. As you discover the world you learn that something has gone terribly wrong -  islands are breaking apart and falling from the sky! It\u2019s up to you to discover the evil that is threatening the universe of Windscape.<br><br>As you travel the world(s) you will gather valuable resources allowing you to craft a plethora of items such as weapons, shields, potions, magical spells and much more. Some items will be just for fun while others are a necessity for your survival. <br> <br>You will meet peaceful NPCs and vicious monsters both on the surface of each island as well as in the dungeons and lairs you uncover along your journey. While I want the islands to work in a non-linear manner, I have decided to make the dungeons more puzzle and combat driven - each with its own style and atmosphere. <br>Windscape will feature tactical fights against larger bosses such as ghosts, ogres and dragons. Of course, there are many valuable items to loot too.<br><br>What I don't want Windscape to be? A stats-driven RPG, a terraforming sandbox game or a first-person action game. This is why I am asking for your support. I\u2019m building this game for the community and hopefully with the community. I feel your feedback is really needed to match my vision with the high standards you, the players, demand.
