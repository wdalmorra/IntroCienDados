If you want to catch up on our development adventures, head over to <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/ http:\/\/astrobasecommand.com\/?page_id=775\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  > Astrobase Command <\/a>.

In addition to being a multifunctional management device, the datapad, your main tool in-game, can also run other kinds of programs. Our plan has always been to make it able to play games. Our first test is Asteroid Shooter, an homage to the glorious games of yore. <br><br>This is certainly not the last!

Not having the NPC pick off a table of pre-authored responses lets our characters be more than one-dimensional cardboard cutouts constantly repeating the same three lines. <br><br><img  src=\"http:\/\/cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/395370\/extras\/Hallway_Talk.png?t=1508945034?t=1510177398\"><br><br>What this actually means is that in Astrobase Command your crew live their lives on your station.
