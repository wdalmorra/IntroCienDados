Influences and borrowings be damned \u2013 it stands alone and is as brilliantly designed, challenging and cunning a package of ideas and aesthetic choices as anything I\u2019ve seen this year.\u201d<br>Wot I Think \u2013 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rockpapershotgun.com\/2014\/10\/31\/review-dungeon-of-the-endless\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock, Paper, Shotgun<\/a><br><br>\u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by the simplicity of its pixels: no individual element of Dungeon of the Endless is especially complicated, but together they form a fiendish and unforgiving challenge. If you\u2019re willing to take that on then it makes it more than worthwhile, borrowing from several genres to create something that feels unique - as well as bursting with personality and smart choices.\u201d<br>8.1\/10 \u2013 <a href=\"http:\/\/uk.ign.com\/articles\/2014\/11\/13\/dungeon-of-the-endless-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >IGN<\/a><br><br>\u201cFrom its setting to its design and aesthetic, Dungeon of the Endless feels like a game built for me. It\u2019s tough and unforgiving, but it\u2019s also fair. Despite all the deaths I spent climbing through the dungeon\u2019s floors, I slowly mastered the game.
