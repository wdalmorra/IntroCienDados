The game even lets you catch those orbs with your head - and if you already have Vive trackers, you can catch them with your feet, too, Kung Fu style.<br><br>What is Holodance? Holo obviously was inspired by Holodeck, so imagine &quot;dancing in the Holodeck&quot;. Of course, &quot;dancing&quot; just means tuning into the rhythm and freely moving with the music. There are orbs arriving perfectly in sync with the music that you need to catch, and curves you need to follow.
