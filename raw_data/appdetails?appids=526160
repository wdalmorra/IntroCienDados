Bond with your animal buddy as you give him a name and wander the world of The Wild Eight together - just remember to watch out for his health and hunger, if you want to keep him by your side. <br><br>Aside from the taming system, Animal Update 0.7 features updated stamina, Steam Trading Cards and Achievements.<\/p><br><h1>About the Game<\/h1>The Wild Eight is in a constant state of improvement, and it is not yet complete.
