Due to a shortage of real warriors, your goal is to tame the entity that harbors itself within the center of your planet. These entities are known as Skyes: youthful beings in dire need of guidance and protection. As you explore the world, you will face many obstacles and, in time, the evil tyrant who is ready to steal control of the Skye before you do. Forget what you know about the traditional turn-based RPG--these intense battles allow you to be in control 100% of the time.
