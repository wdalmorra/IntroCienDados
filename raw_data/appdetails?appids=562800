Your only goal is to create a sophisticated ecosystem - a brutal world of predators or a peaceful garden; breed an intelligent species capable of speech or a super-organism that will consume the stars. With HOUND, you craft the world you want. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHOUND gameplay is simple: you start with an empty world, build your ecosystem, design your first organism and throw it into the void. HOUND\u2019s advanced artificial intelligence (AI) analyses your creation, finds its strengths and weaknesses, then gives it competition in your world. Watch as life evolves before your eyes - literally; the creatures exist in three dimensions, develop legs, wings, and communication. Your organism will fight for survival, stimulating favorable mutations and increasingly more complex life forms. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe AI speeds up natural selection and genetic mutation so that your world will evolve in a matter of days instead of millennia. Every move you make changes the outcome - you can add new organisms, tweak the environment and more through communication with the AI. The twist? Working with the AI can be a productive partnership or a brutal rival. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYour application will be a part of a network that creates one global genetic database and a global ecosystem. AI is blank at the start, but as the network grows, it will improve, building itself with algorithms, picked to fit your individual simulation, and over time your game will become more than just an evolution simulator, as the built-in neural net learns the laws of mutation and genetic recombination.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSuccess in HOUND isn\u2019t about earning \u201cachievements\u201d or beating levels. Success is controlling the program so that you create your perfect world by containing and stabilizing a bursting stream of life.","about_the_game":"Breathe life into an empty void and watch as it grows, evolving into a world of your choosing.
