With this album, Austin Wintory takes you on an immersive, auditory journey through the depths of ABZ\u00db that reflects the games unique visual style and story. From Austin about the album:<br><br><i>&quot;On the heels of JOURNEY's release in 2012, thatgamecompany's Art Director Matt Nava showed me some concept art he'd been making for a new game he was dreaming up: Gorgeous underwater landscapes that straddled the line between realism and fantasy. Not long after, the studio Giant Squid was founded and he invited me to join him in the creation of ABZ\u00db. <br><br>The overall progression was not unlike our prior collaboration on JOURNEY. I started with a theme (&quot;To Know, Water&quot;) very early in the process and then spent the next 3 years developing that material in tandem with the game. Both game and music went through many iterations and conceptual shapes before arriving in what you hear and see now. As always, that process of discovery was challenging and often filled with self-doubt. <br><br>The resulting score is one I can definitely say pushed me into territory I'd never been. The odd combination of large harp ensemble, semi-traditional orchestra and chamber choir, led by a slew of delicate oboe solos by Kristin Naigus, gave me ingredients for experimentation that were simultaneously great fun and deeply intimidating. All the performers brought incredible magic and I'm eternally grateful for their artistry.&quot;<\/i><br><br>The music of ABZ\u00db is composed and produced by Austin Wintory and performed live in Nashville and London by the world famous Nashville Scoring Orchestra, London Voices and ABZ\u00db Harp Ensemble. <br><br>1.
