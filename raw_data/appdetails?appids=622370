Yeah, there are toxic wastes, weird creepy monsters and deadly traps there, and it\u2019s very likely that you will mutate into horrendous shapes and even die a lot, but you would do anything for your four-legged friend \u2013 even becoming a four-legged hairy beast yourself! Fight, mutate, die, repeat: this is Freaky Awesome!<br><br>Freaky Awesome is a hectic action rogue-lite where you have to fight your way out of an old factory, full of mutated monsters and traps; the general layout of the factory and its rooms are procedurally generated. Every enemy leaves behind a poodle of mutagen that can heal you, but also mutates you eventually \u2013 even if you are in the middle of a fight! In order to survive, you will need to adapt quickly to the powers and specific mechanics of every mutation. Tearing off your head to throw it at an enemy? Sure! Laying eggs and seeing tiny copies of you hatching and fighting for you? Why not!
