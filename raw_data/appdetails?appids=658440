These features complement each other and work to build a strong relationship between player and hovercraft that must be maintained in order to survive. The player is encouraged to explore their environment for supplies to maintain their hovercraft and themselves in the vast number of toxic environments teeming with fierce enemies.","supported_languages":"English<strong>*<\/strong><br><strong>*<\/strong>languages with full audio support","header_image":"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/658440\/header.jpg?t=1510114117","website":null,"pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 7, Windows 8 or Windows 10<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> 2.0GHz Dual Core<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 4 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> OpenGL 4.0 \/ DirectX 11 Compatible Graphics Card<br><\/li><li><strong>DirectX:<\/strong> Version 11<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 7 GB available space<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 7, Windows 8 or Windows 10<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 6 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> OpenGL 4.0 \/ DirectX 11 Compatible Graphics Card<br><\/li><li><strong>DirectX:<\/strong> Version 11<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 7 GB available space<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":[],"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> 2.0GHz Dual Core 64-bit<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 4 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> OpenGL 4.0 Compatible Graphics Card<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 8 GB available space<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 4 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> OpenGL 4.0 Compatible Graphics Card<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 8 GB available space<\/li><\/ul>"},"legal_notice":"Enshrouded World\u00ae \u00a9 Brandon Gallo. 2014-2017.
