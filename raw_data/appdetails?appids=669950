The game itself takes place in Hell where the main hero, Lou, is to find a booze and rescue most hot Mistress from the clutches of a fat clown.The game consists of four levels \/ chapters representing different areas of Hell, such as the hellish Big Wack fastfood cafe, Skeletons Slums and the Red Lights District. The idea behind those sub levels is to kill specific Boss. Each Boss represent unique multi stage fight and it is pretty challenging. <br><br>The player has to choose between six weapons and one magical ability. The main feature of the game is that Lou is healed by booze. The more he drinks the more his blood alcohol level increases, which is sorta good fot him.
