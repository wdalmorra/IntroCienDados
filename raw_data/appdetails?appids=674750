The tech that the old version was build with called Microsoft XNA was abandoned by Microsoft in 2010 and it's been a burden to work with. This is why last year we've decided to drop XNA and switch to Unity3D. It's been a lot of frustrating and painful work to port an entire game from one engine to another, but now it's clear it was well worth it - it looks much better now and we're able to add new features and content in no time.<br><br>The use of Unity3D engine also allows us to integrate Steam Workshop, so hopefully we'll see some great stuff that the game's community will make! Other improvements already made are better rendering and physics, new zombie characters and animation, as well as the addition of new enemies trying to get you killed. And the fourth playable character, finally. There's also features like localization including non-English chat, cloud saves, non-Xbox controller support with full controls remapping, overall better stability and performance, as well as many other minor improvements.<br><br>Another great news is that everyone who owns the base version will be granted a 75% off coupon at the game's launch, and will be able to cut its price from $3.99 to just $0.99! It's as low as we could get in order to justify the cost of porting to Unity3D, upgrading the content and keeping the game updated after launch. We really believe that you won't be disappointed by what you're going to get for the one buck!","about_the_game":"<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/674750\/extras\/Gif_Steam.png?t=1509825592\" ><br><br>Build your base by day.
