You can conduct reach studies to select the correct size and type of robot arm, choose the best positioning equipment for your application and use it as a sales tool to help customers visualize solutions. Using VRRS you can:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n- Browse a large selection of pre-configured robotic work cells from the Selection Hall. This will allow you to examine these different work cells in detail and develop an appreciation for their relative size and capabilities. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n- Cells include robot arms designed to be equivalent to arms from ABB, Fanuc, KUKA, Motoman and Universal Robotics. Includes a variety of 6 axis manipulators and delta robots.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n- Cells include a variety of single and multi-axis positioners such as headstocks, tilt\/rotate, skyhook, drop center, H frames, ferris wheels, floor\/ceiling tracks, and multi-axis gantries.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n- Generate a robot cell using a basic Robot Cell Variant Configurator, or build a cell from the ground up in real time.
