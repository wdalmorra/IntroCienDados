Or create a private lobby and invite as many friends as you want: The terminal in the lobby can be used to create a private game. All players who type in the same gamename and enter a multiplayer game will be in the same playthrough. The game is also playable in single player.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Boss &amp; Levels<\/strong><\/h2>You will be able to play through different environments. The environments are procedural generated and will get harder the longer you play. Areas contain handcrafted rooms that create a beautiful atmosphere. Each environment contains a unique boss that, upon defeating, will lead to next area and give a special currency. The special currency persists after death and can be used to unlock items.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Enemies<\/strong><\/h2>In every environment you will encounter environment specific enemies. Every level has 6-8 unique enemies with unique abilities. In addition to enemies you will find hidden rooms, which can either harm you or hold a special reward. You will also find different traps, which can hit you from any angle. With every loop enemies become stronger and more difficult rooms and traps are added. At a certain point enemies will gain more than one ability.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Locomotions<\/strong><\/h2>The game offers four different locomotion types. The classical teleport locomotion. Trackpad locomotion, which is either oriented from hand or head. The Walk-to-Point locomotion, which is a combination of teleport and trackpad. Locomotion can be changed either on the lobby or at any time in game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Misc<\/strong><\/h2>While you are in a playthrough you can find a shopkeeper who will sell a certain amount of items (also locked items). Items can be bought with gold, which is found in a playthrough. Normal gold does not persist through death. Waypoints can be used to teleport to an other discovered waypoint. Waypoints also show a larger portion of the map. If looked to the ground a minimap will appear and show some information, such as droped items and already discovered tiles (marked grey).","about_the_game":"<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/686360\/extras\/about.png?t=1510218854\" ><br><br>Dungeons &amp; Treasure is a roguelike multiplayer created with voxel art for Virtual Reality (VR).<br><br>You will be able to play through different environment.
