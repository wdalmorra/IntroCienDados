It introduces a block-based construction mechanic, allowing player to collect blocks to build bigger and better ships, as well as a destruction mechanic that allows ships to have blocks blown off but keep flying. Vulture is 10 levels of fast-paced fun, pitting the player against waves of tough enemies. A combination of equipable weapons, armour and shields gives players many options and strategies.","supported_languages":"English","reviews":"\u201cIt\u2019s a fun looking game that offers a great twist on the classic arcade vertical shooter.
