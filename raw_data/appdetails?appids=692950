In-game, the main character\u2019s memorable lines move the plot forward; these lines are spoken in anguish within an intricate narrative cycle. (...) The keywords and the struggles they bring the protagonist each appear and disappear in turns, creating a gripping story.\u201d<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.khgames.co.kr\/news\/articleView.html?idxno=93785\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Kyunghyang Games<\/a><br><br>\u201cThe puzzles are intricately made, but a few of them feel forced. (\u2026) However, at the core it is a well-made puzzle game with a deep and intriguing storyline. (\u2026) Unlike the cookie cutter games released lately, this game asked me a simple, yet thought-provoking question.\u201d<br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UPnIGfl33Hk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Metal Kim<\/a><br><br>\u201cThe Dew is a puzzle game whose concept\u2014black and white\u2014 is easy to grasp, with the various gimmicks of each chapter being nicely implemented. You could say that the game only contains the most basic parts of a puzzle game; however, these basics are executed very well, giving the game a solid foundation. The puzzles themselves are quite reasonable both in composition and difficulty, making this a game well worth recommending.\u201d<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/blog.naver.com\/kitpage\/221088463504\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Kutar'k<\/a><br>","header_image":"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/692950\/header.jpg?t=1510250558","website":"http:\/\/www.psychoflux.com\/thedew\/","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows XP<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Intel Pentium 4 Series<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 1 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> CPU-integrated or on-board graphics<br><\/li><li><strong>DirectX:<\/strong> Version 9.0<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 250 MB available space<br><\/li><li><strong>Sound Card:<\/strong> DirectX-compatible sound card<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":[],"linux_requirements":[],"legal_notice":"\u00a9 PsychoFlux Entertainment. \u00a9 ZZICON.
