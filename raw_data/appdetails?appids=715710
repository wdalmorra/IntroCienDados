Here is a short list of tips for you to start:<br>- do it at least 20 minutes a day (30-40 is better) to have significant results;<br>- do it at least 5 days a week;<br>- subvocalizing is bad;<br>- chunking is not so bad;<br>- if you get stuck on one level for two or three weeks don't worry, just keep going, but don't forget to:<br>- push your limits. If you get 80% success rate on the task, move up to the next level. Don't try to stabilize a level you are already doing good.

Cheyne and Alexandra B. Morrison.<br>In short, the study demonstrates the success in using the CWM task to improve working memory, cognitive control and understanding of what has been read.<br><br>Overview<br><br>The CWM exercise consists of the remembering rounds and the recall stage. The number of the rounds in an exercise equals to the current level of the CWM exercise.<br>Every round in the CWM exercise consists of two parts: the Decision making part at the beginning and the Remembering part at the end.<br>There are usually 4 Decision tasks in one round that are followed by an item to Remember. So, for example, it the exercise level is 5 you'll have to remember 5 items in total.<br>After all rounds passed there is a Recall stage where you have to recall all the remembered items.<br>There are two types of the CWM Span Task:<br>Spatial CWM<br>Verbal CWM<br>The Decision and Remembering\/Recall parts of the exercise are different for each type.<br><br>Spatial CWM<br><br>On the Decision stage of the Spatial CWM you'll have to make a decision whether the displayed figure is symmetric on the Y axis.

If not - press No.<br>On the Remembering stage of the Verbal CWM you are shown the alphabet letter. Remember the letter on every round.<br>On the Recall stage you have to recall the letters in the order they appeared (by clicking the cells in the grid).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mental Math<\/h2>Mental Math is a brain game for testing \/ improving your mental skill calculations.<br>We do calculations in the mind and improve your attention, working memory and processing speed.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Corsi<\/h2>Exercises Corsi is the implementation of the Corsi Block-Tapping test.<br>Corsi Block-Tapping is a variant of the memory task. It was originally based on the Digit Span task, but unlike Digit Span, it requires the use of visuo-spatial memory.<br><br>The process of the Corsi block tapping task requires the subject to observe the sequence of blocks, and then repeat the sequence back in order. The task starts with a small number of blocks and gradually increases in length up. The test measures both the number of correct sequences and the longest sequence remembered.<br><br>This number is known as the Corsi Span, and averages about 5 for normal human subjects. An fMRI study involving subjects undergoing this test revealed that while the sequence length increases, general brain activity remains the same. So while humans may show encoding difficulty, this is not related to overall brain activation. Whether able to perform the task well or not the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex is highly involved. Corsi blocks tasks with a normal forward order requires support from the visuospatial skech pad, but not from the phonological loop. When the sequence to be recalled becomes longer than three or four items, central executive resources are used.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fastest<\/h2>Fastest is a reaction rate test.<br>Knowing your reaction speed, it can always be compared with other people. This is necessary in order to properly organize their training. If suddenly the reaction rate began to fall, then urgently increase the number of exercises to improve the reaction speed. You may not notice how fast the reaction starts to fall. This often happens with many athletes. Look, a huge number of athletes performed with success, and then somehow slipped unnoticed to bad results. And no one can understand what happened.
