Making it from start to finish in the best time possible is your aim; your weapon of manipulation, your instinctive reflexes and a dash of ingenuity are key to obtaining top spot. Chromalocity\u2019s simple movement system is coupled with more complex interactions as you progress.

Laser obstacles, strange switch targets and gates to pass through will put you in a spin as you try to find the fastest way through the game's levels.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About Wrecked Angle Studios<\/h2>Based in the nurturing home of indie games development in Melbourne, Australia, Wrecked Angle Studios built the game to stand as an entry-point to its three core genres; Shooters, Platformers, and Speedrunning. For many, any of the three genres can create hesitation or straight up aversion. We wanted to develop a game that would act as a player's first steps into those three. Much of the team have come from backgrounds involving these genres and wanted to tackle this task with simplicity and the player's experience in mind. Those new to the genres can slowly work their way through, while veterans of the genres will have a task on their hands to find all the secrets to the levels as, they too, strive to overcome any challenge thrown at them.","about_the_game":"A mysterious tower lurks above the skyline, high above the clouds.
