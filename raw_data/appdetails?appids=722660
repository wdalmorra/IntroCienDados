Hire an awesome team, skilled in technical, design, operational, or sales aspects of your startup.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build out your product<\/h2>Create your very own product by researching the market and building bigger and better features that match your users' demands. But building features isn't everything! You must ensure they are tested and bug-free, well secured, and tuned for performance. Features can also be upgraded and enhanced, for example by incorporating responsive design, or adding accessibility.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Plan your infrastructure<\/h2>Even the best software is worthless without the right hardware to run on.

But pitching your venture to a potential investor is no easy feat! Research and understand your would-be investors, put together a convincing slide-deck, and watch them offer you millions for a small share in your company. P.S. don't forget to haggle!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Deck out your office<\/h2>What startup doesn't want to be the talk of town for its fancy office? Buy all sorts of gadgets and furniture for your office and give your employees yet another reason to stick around.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Make a big exit<\/h2>Sooner or later, every founder wants to make an exit from their startup and see the fruits of their labours on a check.
