When captured by Dredrick and his crew she was kept alive for her skills at a helm. None we're overly impressed by her piloting, but she did manage to kill the previous pilot with a stimcoffee mug when being brought onboard. Dredrick was impressed and she soon joined the crew raiding, rising to a prominence of awesome.

Had he not suffered traumatic brain injuries during a college nutball career, perhaps life would have been different for Tommy. As it were, before his school could have him submitted for medical treatment he ran off to become a space viking. His brain had been damaged leaving him with intermittent episodes of intense rage and\/or psychedelia. Among the best fighters on the crew, Tommy K never misses a raid. He forgot his last name.<br><br>Danny Zicarus, Zica. Zica lived on a makeshift space station orbiting a white dwarf in an otherwise abandoned system. When a ship was spotted in the system, Zica stole one of the station's only shuttles and joined up with the space vikings. An odd mix of farmer and thief in her past life, Zica is somewhat unpredictable. She's become a wizard with explosives and joins every raid to ensure effective use of ammunition. Zica has a common expression taken up by the crew &quot;More ammo, more kablammo.&quot; <br><br><br><strong>Multiball Studios<\/strong><br><br>Based in Vancouver, Multiball Studios was created by Adam Thompson and Scott Banducci.
