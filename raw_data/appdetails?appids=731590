The enemies are nasty in all the right ways, the weapons are straight out of some forgotten b-movie and the music sounds like that nightmare sex room out the back of the Roadhouse bar in Twin Peaks... Genuinely, this feels both like a lost early 90s treasure and a real 2017 original\u201d<br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rockpapershotgun.com\/2017\/11\/03\/best-new-indie-games-steam-nov\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock Paper Shotgun<\/a><br><br>\u201cHere\u2019s an FPS with an interesting, albeit garish, retro sensibility...
