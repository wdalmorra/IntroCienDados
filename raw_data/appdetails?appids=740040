As a father myself it was important to me that the design behind this game evokes a sense of exploration. The game started as a small side project meant for my 4 year old daughter to play.

I hope that your own child has as much fun as mine has.<br><br>Also important to note is that there are no micro transactions, unlockables (everything is unlocked from the get go) nor are there any cards or achievements. These things are thrown at children constantly and I am personally not a fan of them so I decided to leave these things out.<br><br>The game is about having fun, trying to find all the kittens, collect all the fish or try to get the golden fish yet it won't force or push you to do so. If you do collect everything in a level, the end reward is a nice fireworks show, nothing more. I wanted to keep the rewards to a minimum and something that means more than some unlockable reward or a high score, something that can be experienced.<br><br><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/740040\/extras\/PWG_Features.png?t=1510119133\" ><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Play as Gilbert or your own custom kitty.<br><\/li><li>Fully dynamic day \/ night cycle.<br><\/li><li>Start the game at whatever (in-game) time you want.<br><\/li><li>Seasonal events (Halloween and Christmas).<br><\/li><li>Choose which level to start and travel between levels during gameplay.<br><\/li><li>Two in-game seasons, summer and winter.
